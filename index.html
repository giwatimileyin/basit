        Across the miles, our love shall reign,<br> Bound by memories, despite the pain. <br> You, a paradox of grace and might, <br> A baddie heart, yet a soul so light. <br>
        As the sun set on our time apart, <br> Know my love is constant art. <br> Through rain and shine, our bound will stay, <br> Guiding us together, come what may. <br>
        In a world apart, my heart still feels, <br> Your loving touch, your gentle heals. <br> In sunset' glow and dawn's embrace, <br> i see your smile, your shy, sweet grace. <br>
        Though years may pass and skies may rain, <br> Our love remains, a timeless chain. <br> in every journey, near or far, <br> You are my guiding, shining star.
